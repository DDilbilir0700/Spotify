Instructions for API Key Configuration

To enhance the security of API credentials, the client ID and client secret are not publicly shared. 
Consequently, the project cannot be executed unless the necessary API credentials, including the client ID and secret, are provided.

To obtain your Spotify API credentials:

Visit https://developer.spotify.com

Create a new app and obtain your Client ID and secret.

Create an Info.plist file in the project and name it Keys.plist

Add your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret inside Keys.plist

Run the application.

Or contact me at lenispath@gmail.com to obtain the necessary Spotify API credentials for running the application.
